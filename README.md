I'm passionate about board games, so I decided to combine my hobby with programming and build a website that allows people to discover new board games and meet up to play.

The goal of this project was to create a beautiful, fully responsive website and practice my problem-solving and programming skills.
In this project, I put great emphasis on clean code, giving purposeful names, and creating reusable components and hooks to not write the same code more than once.
I practiced form submission, authentication, uploading images, asynchronous code, handling errors, routing, loading data, react hooks, and much more.

Technologies used: ReactJS, Material UI, react-router-dom, react-hook-form, Firestore Database, Firebase for Authentication, Storage, and Hosting.

Website Application:
1. Home page that consists of 3 sections:
   * Hero section with a short explanation about the website.
   * Sneak peek at the 4 upcoming events.
   * Call to action - a call to create a new event.
2. Games page that consists of 2 parts: search bar and list of games. You can browse and search for games.
3. Events page that consists of a preview of all upcoming events.
4. Event page - a click on the preview event will take you to a detailed page with all event information. The event page has 2 tabs:
   * About tab that displays all event information
   * Discussion tab that allows the user to read, add, edit, and delete messages in the discussion.
5. Login/Register pages
6. Create Event page - each logged-in user can create a new event.
7. User events page - each logged-in user can see the events they created here with an option to delete. They also can see the events they're attending.


There was a lot of attention to detail invested here.
   * Emphasis on user experience and user interface from scratch, including building color themes, element placement, etc.
   * Dark and light modes for users to choose whatever they prefer.
   * Fully responsive and compatible with different screen sizes.
   * Dialogs and alerts displaying useful information.
